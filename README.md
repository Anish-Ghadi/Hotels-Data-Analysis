# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **data analysis and visualization** using Python.  
The notebook walks through the process of importing data, cleaning and transforming it, exploring patterns, and generating insights with visualizations.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project is focused on:
- Exploring datasets and understanding their structure  
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data (handling null values, formatting dates, etc.)  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Generating summary statistics and metrics  
- Visualizing key trends using plots and charts  

It serves as a hands-on example of how to approach a real-world dataset.
