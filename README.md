# ðŸ“Š Hotel Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **hotel revenue and performance analysis**.  
The notebook demonstrates how to clean, transform, and analyze hotel booking data to calculate important hospitality industry KPIs such as **RevPAR, ADR, GOPPAR, and TRevPAR**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
The hotel industry relies on key metrics to measure performance and profitability. In this notebook, we:
- Clean and preprocess raw hotel booking data  
- Perform time-based aggregation (monthly & yearly trends)  
- Calculate key financial and operational KPIs  
- Visualize trends with charts for better insights  

This project is useful for **Data Analysts, Hotel Revenue Managers, and Students** learning data analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Metrics Explained
- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room):**  
  \[
  \text{RevPAR} = \frac{\text{Total Room Revenue}}{\text{Total Available Rooms}}
  \]

- **ADR (Average Daily Rate):**  
  \[
  \text{ADR} = \frac{\text{Total Room Revenue}}{\text{Number of Rooms Sold}}
  \]

- **GOPPAR (Gross Operating Profit per Available Room):**  
  \[
  \text{GOPPAR} = \frac{\text{Gross Operating Profit}}{\text{Total Available Rooms}}
  \]

- **TRevPAR (Total Revenue per Available Room):**  
  \[
  \text{TRevPAR} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Total Available Rooms}}
  \]
